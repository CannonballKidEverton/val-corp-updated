            Most companies discover their operational risks at the point those
            risks become consequences. By then the cost is rarely the risk
            itself \u2014 it is the absence of warning.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-[1.55em]">
            The Risk Engine exists to close that gap. It is an operating
            instrument \u2014 not a software product, not a dashboard, not a
            report. A company&rsquo;s position is scored across twelve
            operational domains and tracked through the lifecycle of the
            company, not the lifecycle of the engagement.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-[1.55em]">
            Twelve is the smallest number of axes that captures the operational
            shape of a company across stage, sector, and structure; it is also
            the largest number that an operator can hold in working memory while
            making a decision. Every domain on the list has, at some point in
            the partners&rsquo; combined operating career, been the domain that
            determined an outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            The instrument is built and operated by Valantai. The intelligence
            accumulates inside the institution. Clients receive the output:
            ranked exposures, mitigation pathways, and the operational pressure
            that comes from continuous observation rather than periodic review.
